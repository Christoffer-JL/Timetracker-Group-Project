# Timetracker Group Project
Welcome to the Timetracker Group Project! This is a project that was completed by a team of 23 individuals, including myself as one of the project leads, as part of a school assignment. The goal of this project was to learn how to work collaboratively in a large group setting.
As project leads, my co-lead and I were responsible for overseeing the development process, coordinating tasks and timelines, and ensuring that the project met all of the assignment requirements. We worked closely with the other team members to ensure that everyone had the support and resources they needed to succeed. 
**A demonstration of the system has been recorded by me and can be found uploaded to Youtube on this link: https://youtu.be/zdRcE4xK6-o (Note that even though this is in swedish, english subtitles are provided).**

## Project Overview
The Timetracker system is a full-stack web application that allows users to track their time spent on various tasks. The backend of the system is written in Java, while the frontend uses HTML, TypeScript, and CSS. The Svelte framework was utilized to develop the frontend.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Timetracker system, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions in the README files located in the backend and frontend directories. The system is designed to be run on a server and accessed through a web browser.

## Additional Resources
In addition to the source code, this repository includes a folder containing documents that were produced by the group throughout the course of the project. These documents provide further insight into the development process and can be useful for anyone interested in learning more about how the system was built.

## Acknowledgements
We are very pleased with the result of this project and would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of all 23 team members who contributed to its success. Special thanks to Nils, my co-lead partner, for their hard work and support throughout the development process.

Additional thanks to you, the reader, for taking interest in the Timetracker Group Project!
